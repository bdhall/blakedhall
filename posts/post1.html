				    <p class="card-text">Hey everybody, I'm pleased to announce that I'm going back to college for my second bachelors! On June 26th, 2018 I'll be starting classes--two, in fact. CS161 (Intro to C++ Programming) and CS225 (Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists).</p>

				    <p>But Blake, you say, you already have a BA in Mathematics, why not go for a Masters program? Or, why not a Bootcamp? There are a bunch of reasons. But what it really comes down to is that I am making a earnest attempt to steer my career towards the realm of Software Development. In order to be a software developer, I need a firm foundation in programming which I did not get in my first degree and would not get in a Masters program.</p>

					<p>As for bootcamps, there isn't a lot of variety in my area. Yes, I could do an online bootcamp but based off of the high costs and the fact that CS bachelors are valued more in industry (if for nothing else than getting past HR), it seems as OSU CS is the way to go!</p>
