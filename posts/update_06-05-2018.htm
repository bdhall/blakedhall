			    <p class="card-text">I've just been plugging away at Colt Steele's bootcamp; according to Udemy I am only 22% complete. I've watched up through DOM manipulation using JavaScript, but haven't started the jQuery section yet.</p>

			    <p>I'm actually impressing myself with how quickly my coding skills are coming along! For a long time all I ever wanted to do was learn how to do something simple like a to-do list, and now that's easy! I'm getting used to the CSS/HTML/JS trio and it's really amazing how well they work together to create functional tools. Very exciting!</p>

			    <p>There's a lot more to learn, though, and that's super exciting because it says something about the complexity and usefulness of the tools I'll be able to create soon. Classes start in 20 days... it's a bizarre feeling. Hopefully it will be more enjoyable than stressful!</p>
